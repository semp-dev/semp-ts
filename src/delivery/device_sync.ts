/**
 * Device-sync extension marker per draft-gokce-semp-client §5.6.
 *
 * Every sync envelope MUST carry the marker in `brief.extensions`
 * with `required: true`. The marker's `data` object carries a
 * single `kind` field that names the sync category; each sync
 * kind declares the `kind` value it produces.
 *
 * The marker lives in the brief so the home server can apply
 * correct policy without decrypting the enclosure. Clients
 * receiving an envelope with this marker MUST NOT surface the
 * envelope as ordinary correspondence in any mailbox view.
